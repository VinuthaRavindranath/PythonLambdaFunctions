Pythonâ€™s filter() is a built-in function that allows you to process an iterable and 
extract those items that satisfy a given condition. This process is commonly known as a filtering operation. 
With filter(), you can apply a filtering function to an iterable and produce a new iterable with the items that satisfy the condition at hand. 
In Python, filter() is one of the tools you can use for functional programming.
