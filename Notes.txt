What is a Lambda Function?
Lambda functions are similar to user-defined functions but without a name. They're commonly referred to as anonymous functions.

Lambda functions are efficient whenever you want to create a function that will only contain simple expressions â€“ that is,
 expressions that are usually a single line of a statement.

How to Define a Lambda Function
You can define a lambda function like this:

SYNTAX
lambda argument(s) : expression

lambda is a keyword in Python for defining the anonymous function.

argument(s) is a placeholder, that is a variable that will be used to hold the value you want to pass into the function expression. 
A lambda function can have multiple variables depending on what you want to achieve.

expression is the code you want to execute in the lambda function.
